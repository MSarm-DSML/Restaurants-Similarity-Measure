# restaurants.similarity.measure

We use data from Web crawling to pinpoint restaurants similar to others. It may serve both for the purpose of recommendation system or lead for a b2b company intermediary between restaurants and clients. 

# instructions

1. run nlp.

# Extras

Each data set represents a city, and within each city, there is a collection of scraped restaurants, 
including comments from people who have visited these establishments. The NLP code I used employs doc2vec, a shallow neural network that provides similarities between topics, in this case, restaurants. I should also note that the data I shared is just a small subset of the larger dataset I have collected.

# On the scraping

The scraping code has not been displayed here yet. Weather this will or not be made available has not yet been decided. The 
scraped web page is Trip Advisor. 

# Thanks.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


At.,
Matheus.
